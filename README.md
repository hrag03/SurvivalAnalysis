# Telco Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

This repository contains code and data for analyzing customer lifetime value (CLV) in the telecommunications industry using survival analysis techniques. The analysis is performed on a dataset named `telco.csv`, which includes various customer attributes and tenure information.

## Setup
- The analysis is implemented in Python using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Lifelines, and Seaborn. Make sure to have these libraries installed in your environment.
- The dataset `telco.csv` should be placed in the same directory as the Python script.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Import necessary libraries and load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Perform data preprocessing steps such as one-hot encoding for categorical variables and dropping unnecessary columns.

2. **Modeling:**
   - Fit survival models including Exponential, Log-Logistic, Log-Normal, and Weibull models using Lifelines library.
   - Evaluate the models using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to determine the best fitting model.

3. **Customer Lifetime Value Calculation:**
   - Estimate the CLV using the best fitting model.
   - Adjust CLV for discounting using a discount rate.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the estimated survival functions for different models.
   - Plot the distribution of CLV across various customer segments.

## Files
- `telco.csv`: Dataset containing customer information.
- `SurvivalAnalysis.py`: Python script for performing the analysis.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the analysis.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries if not already installed.
3. Place the `telco.csv` dataset in the same directory as the Python script.
4. Run the `SurvivalAnalysis.py` script to perform the analysis.
5. Explore the results and visualizations generated by the script.

## Results
- The analysis provides insights into customer churn behavior and estimates the CLV for different customer segments.
- The best fitting model based on AIC is selected for further analysis and decision-making.
